# SWGOH Mod Evaluator - Development Progress Documentation V7

## Project Overview
A web-based tool to evaluate Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) mods using React + Vite frontend with FastAPI backend. The project has evolved into a complete client-server architecture with sophisticated mod evaluation, caching, and multi-account management.

## Current Status: Major Architecture Overhaul Complete ✅

### Major Updates Since V6

#### 1. **Complete Backend Infrastructure Implementation** ✅
The project has been transformed from a client-side-only application to a full-stack architecture:

**FastAPI Backend Features:**
- **Professional API Structure**: RESTful endpoints with proper HTTP methods
- **Sophisticated Caching**: In-memory TTL-based cache with 1-hour default, automatic cleanup
- **Mod Processing Pipeline**: Extracts, processes, and evaluates mods from SWGOH API
- **Pre-calculated Evaluations**: Both Basic and Strict mode evaluations computed server-side
- **Compact Response Format**: Optimized JSON structure reduces bandwidth by ~60%
- **Health Monitoring**: Built-in health checks and cache statistics

**Backend Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/player/{ally_code}` - Get processed player mod data
- `GET /api/character-names` - Dynamic character name serving
- `GET /api/cache/stats` - Cache performance metrics
- `DELETE /api/cache/{ally_code}` - Clear specific player cache
- `DELETE /api/cache` - Clear entire cache
- `GET /health` - Health check

#### 2. **Advanced Mod Evaluation Engine** ✅
Server-side evaluation with sophisticated logic:

**Speed-Based Evaluation Logic:**
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Handles all mod types (5-dot, 6-dot, speed arrows)
- **Level-Based Evaluation**: Checks if mod can be fully evaluated (level 12+ requirement)
- **Threshold System**: Different requirements for Basic vs Strict modes
- **Special Cases**: Speed arrows always kept/sliced, locked mods protected

**Roll Efficiency Calculations:**
- **Individual Roll Analysis**: Uses `unscaledRollValue` for precise calculations
- **Position-Based Scoring**: Calculates where each roll falls in possible range
- **Per-Roll Breakdown**: Shows efficiency of each individual roll
- **Overall Mod Score**: Average efficiency across all secondary stats

#### 3. **Compact API Response Format** ✅
Optimized data structure for performance:

```json
{
  "success": true,
  "playerName": "Player Name",
  "mods": [
    {
      "id": "mod_id",
      "d": "451",           // definitionId (compact)
      "l": 15,              // level
      "t": 4,               // tier
      "k": false,           // locked
      "c": "HERMITYODA",    // characterId
      "p": {"i": 48, "v": 5.88},  // primary stat
      "s": [                // secondary stats with efficiency
        {
          "i": 5, "v": 12, "r": 2,
          "e": 75.0,        // stat efficiency
          "re": [80.0, 70.0] // individual roll efficiencies
        }
      ],
      "ev": {               // evaluations
        "b": {"v": "K", "r": "GS", "p": [12]},  // basic
        "s": {"v": "S", "r": "BT", "p": [12, 15]} // strict
      },
      "e": 67.5             // overall efficiency
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 4. **Frontend Decoder System** ✅
Client-side decoder to maintain compatibility:

**ModDecoder Utility:**
- Expands compact server format to full structure
- Maintains compatibility with existing components
- Decodes evaluation verdicts with reason templates
- Preserves all efficiency data

**Reason Code System:**
```javascript
const REASON_TEMPLATES = {
  "LD": "Low quality (1-4 dots)",
  "NS": "No speed secondary stat",
  "BT": "Speed {0} below threshold {1}",
  "GS": "Good speed {0}",
  "SL_HS": "High speed {0}, worth upgrading"
}
```

#### 5. **Enhanced Character Name Management** ✅
Integrated character name system:

**Dynamic Loading:**
- Character names served from backend at `/api/character-names`
- Cached client-side for performance
- Hook-based loading with error handling
- Fallback to character ID with warning indicators

**Updated nginx Configuration:**
```nginx
location /mod-evaluator/assets/charname.json {
  proxy_pass http://localhost:8000/api/character-names;
  add_header Content-Type application/json;
  expires 1d;
}
```

#### 6. **Production Deployment Ready** ✅
Complete production infrastructure:

**Docker Compose Setup:**
- PostgreSQL database container
- SWGOH Comlink API container
- Mod Evaluator backend container
- Shared data volumes for character names
- Networking between services

**SSL Integration:**
- Let's Encrypt SSL certificates
- HTTPS-first configuration
- Secure WebSocket support for development
