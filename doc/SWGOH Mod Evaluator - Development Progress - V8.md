# SWGOH Mod Evaluator - Development Progress Documentation V8

## Project Overview
A web-based tool to evaluate Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) mods using React + Vite frontend with FastAPI backend. The project implements multiple evaluation approaches incrementally, as originally planned, starting with speed-based evaluation and systematically building toward the comprehensive efficiency system described in the original documentation.

## Current Status: Workflow-Based Evaluation System Implemented

### Major Changes Since V7

#### 1. **Workflow-Based Evaluation System** ‚úÖ
The evaluation logic has been restructured from hardcoded Basic/Strict modes to a configurable workflow system:

**Implementation Details:**
- **Data-Driven Workflows**: Evaluation rules defined in configuration files
- **Multiple Check Types**: 
  - `stat_threshold`: Check any stat against thresholds
  - `combined_stats`: Evaluate multiple stats together
  - `point_threshold`: Full scoring with synergies (implemented but not yet used)
  - `speed_arrow`: Special handling for speed arrows
  - `needs_leveling`: Leveling recommendations
- **Three Current Workflows**:
  - `beginner`: Keep any speed (formerly Basic mode)
  - `begin_poor`: More lenient thresholds
  - `comprehensive`: Template for future development

**Note**: The comprehensive scoring system is implemented but NOT yet integrated into any workflow.

#### 2. **Frontend-Driven Evaluation** ‚úÖ
Architectural change where evaluation logic moved from backend to frontend:

**What Changed:**
- Backend no longer calculates evaluations
- All evaluation happens in `workflowEvaluator.js`
- Backend only provides mod data with efficiency calculations
- Instant evaluation changes when switching workflows (no API calls)

**Backend Simplified Response:**
```json
{
  "mods": [
    {
      "id": "mod_id",
      "d": "451",           // definitionId
      "l": 15,              // level
      "t": 4,               // tier
      "k": false,           // locked
      "c": "HERMITYODA",    // characterId
      "cn": "Hermit Yoda",  // characterDisplayName
      "p": {"i": 48, "v": 5.88},  // primary stat
      "s": [...],           // secondary stats with roll efficiency
      "e": 67.5             // overall roll efficiency
    }
  ]
}
```

#### 3. **Expandable Mod Details Modal** ‚úÖ
Click any mod to see expanded view:

- Full mod information display
- Secondary stats with visual efficiency bars
- Individual roll efficiency visualization
- **Simple one-line evaluation reason** (e.g., "Has speed secondary")
- Responsive modal with keyboard support

#### 4. **Database Integration for Character Names** ‚úÖ
Performance optimization for character name resolution:

**Previous**: N individual database queries (one per character)
**Now**: Single batched query for all characters
**Result**: ~95% reduction in database calls

#### 5. **Debug Mode** ‚úÖ
Development feature for testing:
- Add `#debug` to URL
- Shows mod scores on cards
- Console logging of evaluation details
- Helps verify workflow logic

### Technical Architecture

#### Current Evaluation Flow
1. Frontend receives mod data from backend
2. User selects evaluation workflow
3. `workflowEvaluator.js` applies rules based on:
   - Mod dots (5 or 6)
   - Mod tier (Grey/Green/Blue/Purple/Gold)
   - Mod level (1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15)
4. Returns verdict: Keep/Sell/Slice/Level

#### Key Components

**Frontend Additions:**
- `src/utils/workflowEvaluator.js` - Evaluation engine
- `src/config/evaluationWorkflows.js` - Workflow definitions
- `src/components/ModDetailModal.jsx` - Expandable view
- `src/components/StatColumn.jsx` - Stat visualization

**Backend Changes:**
- Removed evaluation logic from `evaluation_engine.py`
- Added batched character name queries
- Simplified response structure

### Current Features Status

#### ‚úÖ Working Features

**Evaluation:**
- Three workflow modes (beginner, begin_poor, comprehensive template)
- Client-side evaluation with instant switching
- Roll efficiency calculations
- Debug mode for development

**User Interface:**
- Expandable mod cards
- Visual efficiency displays
- Simple evaluation reasons (one line)
- Modal interactions

**Performance:**
- Batched database queries
- Client-side processing
- Efficient data structures

#### üîß Implemented But Not Active
- Comprehensive point scoring system (code exists but no workflow uses it)
- Synergy calculations (implemented but not tested)
- WorkflowManager component (partially built)

#### ‚ùå Not Yet Implemented (From Original Plan)
- Sorting functionality
- Export functionality (CSV, etc.)
- Additional evaluation methods beyond current three
- Full efficiency-based evaluation from original documentation
- Calibration recommendations

### What Changed From V7

**Removed:**
- Backend evaluation logic
- Pre-calculated evaluation verdicts in API responses
- Complex evaluation result structures

**Added:**
- Workflow configuration system
- Frontend evaluation engine
- Expandable mod details
- Batched database operations

**Modified:**
- Evaluation happens client-side
- Simplified backend responsibilities
- Character names now included in response

### Known Limitations

1. **Scoring System**: Implemented but not tested in any workflow
2. **Limited Workflows**: Only three workflows, two actively used
3. **No Sorting**: Can't sort mods by any criteria
4. **No Export**: Can't export recommendations

### Next Development Phases

Based on the original incremental plan:

**Phase 9**: Testing and Integration
- Test the comprehensive scoring system
- Create workflows that use point thresholds
- Verify synergy calculations work correctly

**Phase 10**: Additional Features
- Implement sorting (by speed, efficiency, character)
- Add export functionality
- Create more evaluation workflows

**Phase 11**: Advanced Features (per original documentation)
- Full efficiency-based evaluation system
- Calibration recommendations
- Additional evaluation methods

## Key Clarifications

### What This System Is
- Incremental implementation as originally planned
- Currently focused on workflow-based evaluation
- Foundation for more complex evaluation methods

### What This System Is NOT
- Not a character-specific optimizer
- Not tracking historical changes
- Not doing batch operations on multiple mods

### Current Evaluation Capabilities
- Speed-based thresholds
- Combined stat checks (implemented but not used)
- Point scoring (implemented but not tested)
- Simple pass/fail decisions with one-line reasons

## Conclusion

The project has successfully implemented the workflow-based evaluation system as the next step in the original incremental plan. The architecture now supports adding more sophisticated evaluation methods without major changes. The comprehensive scoring system is ready for testing but needs workflows that actually use it. The focus remains on building toward the full efficiency-based system described in the original documentation, one tested component at a time.
