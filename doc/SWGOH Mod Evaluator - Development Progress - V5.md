You're absolutely right! You asked me to:

**"Please read those files - I had to make a few fixes for things that didn't work and update the V5 of the current project instead of creating a new one..."**

Here's the updated V5 documentation with all your fixes:

# SWGOH Mod Evaluator - Development Progress Documentation V5 (Updated)

## Project Overview
A web-based tool to evaluate Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) mods using React + Vite. The project implements multiple evaluation approaches incrementally, with a focus on user experience and multi-account management.

## Current Status: Phase 5 Complete ✅

### Major Updates Since V4

#### 1. **Top Navigation Bar with Multi-Account Support** ✅
A fixed navigation bar has been implemented at the top of the page:

- **Fixed Position**: Always visible at the top of the page
- **Player Display**: Shows current player name with dropdown
- **Account Switching**: Quick switch between saved accounts
- **Refresh Button**: Updates player data with rate limiting
- **Mobile Responsive**: Hamburger menu for mobile devices
- **Add New Player**: Easy access to add additional accounts
- **Last Updated Time**: Shows when data was last refreshed

#### 2. **Multi-Player Account Management** ✅
Complete account management system:

- **Multiple Accounts**: Store unlimited player accounts locally
- **Data Caching**: Each player's mod data is cached to reduce API calls
- **Last Used Memory**: Automatically loads the last used player
- **Player Names**: Displays player names fetched from API
- **Persistent Storage**: All data saved in localStorage

#### 3. **Smart Data Refresh System** ✅
Intelligent refresh mechanism with rate limiting:

- **Rate Limiting**: 1-hour cooldown between refreshes (per player)
- **Visual Feedback**: Spinning animation during refresh
- **Last Updated Display**: Shows when data was last refreshed
- **Dev Mode**: Shift+Click bypasses rate limit for testing
- **Success/Error Messages**: Clear feedback on refresh status
- **Event Passing**: Fixed to properly detect Shift key

#### 4. **UI/UX Improvements** ✅

**Desktop Enhancements:**
- Slide-out filter panel (replaces inline filters)
- Cleaner header with reorganized stats
- Combined efficiency and recommendation stats
- Better visual hierarchy
- Reduced top padding for better space utilization

**Mobile Enhancements:**
- Scrollable header (not fixed on mobile)
- Slide-out navigation menu
- Touch-friendly controls
- Responsive grid layout

#### 5. **Filter Panel Improvements** ✅
- **Universal Panel**: Same slide-out panel for desktop and mobile
- **Vertical Tab**: "FILTERS" written vertically on the right edge
- **Better Organization**: All filters in one accessible location
- **Scalable Design**: Ready for additional filters in future updates

#### 6. **Mod Tier Filtering** ✅
New filtering capability added:

- **Toggle Buttons**: Consistent with other filters (not dropdown)
- **Tier Options**: All / Gold (A) / Purple (B) / Blue (C) / Green (D) / Grey (E)
- **Visual Consistency**: Uses same toggle button styling as other filters
- **Combines with Other Filters**: Works seamlessly with character, recommendation, and locked filters

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Account Storage Structure
```javascript
// localStorage structure
{
  "swgoh_saved_players": [
    {
      "allyCode": "123456789",
      "name": "PlayerName",
      "data": { /* full player data */ },
      "lastUpdated": 1234567890
    }
  ],
  "swgoh_last_used_player": "123456789",
  "swgoh_temp_locked_mods": ["modId1", "modId2"],
  "swgoh_evaluation_mode": "basic"
}
```

#### Navigation Component
- Displays current player with dropdown menu
- Shows last updated time
