# Mods - Star Wars: Galaxy of Heroes

Mods (short for modifications) are equippable resources that are part of the character progression system to increase the power of characters. They are the only part of the system that allows players to choose what stats they would like to increase. The system unlocks at Player Level 50 and they can be equipped to characters once they have reached Level 50 and Mod Battles 1-A has been completed. Each character is able to equip up to 6 mods at one time.

There is a limit of 500 unequipped mods that players can store in their inventory, equipped mods do not count toward this limit. Once this limit is reached, all newly obtained mods will go the player's inbox and current mods will have to be sold to make space for the new ones. Mods bought from the Mod Store will expire after 30 days, mods earned as rewards from Galactic Challenge will expire after 7 days, and mods rewarded in all other events will expire after 3 days if left uncollected.

## Breakdown of Mods

### Mod Name
The name of the mod contains the rarity, tier, set, and slot.

### Mod Rarity
The rarity of the mod determines how powerful the Primary Stats will be and is indicated in the name by a Roman Numeral and graphically by dots just above the mod image. Rarity is mainly referred to as dots or with the actual number and the letter of the Tier. For example the mod above could be referred to as a 5A mod. Mod rarity currently ranges from 1 to 6.

In order to equip a 6 dot mod the character must be Gear Level 12 and 7 stars.

#### Primary Stat Values by Rarity

| Primary Stat | • | • • | • • • | • • • • | • • • • • | • • • • • • |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| Accuracy | 7.5% | 8% | 8.75% | 10.5% | 12% | 30% |
| Critical Avoidance | 15% | 16% | 18% | 21% | 24% | 35% |
| Critical Chance | 7.5% | 8% | 8.75% | 10.5% | 12% | 20% |
| Critical Damage | 22.5% | 24% | 27% | 31.5% | 36% | 42% |
| Defense | 3.75% | 4% | 7.75% | 8% | 11.75% | 20% |
| Health | 1.88% | 2% | 3.88% | 4% | 5.88% | 16% |
| Offense | 1.88% | 2% | 3.88% | 4% | 5.88% | 8.5% |
| Potency | 15% | 16% | 18% | 21% | 24% | 30% |
| Protection | 7.5% | 8% | 15.5% | 16% | 23.5% | 24% |
| Speed | 17 | 19 | 21 | 26 | 30 | 32 |
| Tenacity | 15% | 16% | 18% | 21% | 24% | 35% |

### Mod Tier
Mod Tiers determine how powerful the Secondary Stats on mods can be by allowing them to have additional increases (rolls) to randomly chosen secondary stats. The max additional rolls any individual stat can have is 4 so any secondary stat with a 5 next to it will no longer be eligible to get additional increases. Mod Tiers are indicated by a letter A-E in the Mod Name and by color in the mod image. Mod tiers can be increased by Slicing the mod.

| Rarity | Tier | Additional Stat Increases | Total Stat Rolls |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1-5 | E | 0 | 4 |
| 1-5 | D | 1 | 5 |
| 1-5 | C | 2 | 6 |
| 1-5 | B | 3 | 7 |
| 1-5 | A | 4 | 8 |
| 6 | E | 0 | 8 |
| 6 | D | 5 | 9 |
| 6 | C | 6 | 10 |
| 6 | B | 7 | 11 |
| 6 | A | 8 | 12 |

## Slicing
Slicing allows mods at lower tiers (E) to be upgraded to a higher tier (A) which will increase a random secondary stat each time it goes up a tier. Slicing is the only way to get 6 Dot mods by upgrading a 5A (V-A) mod to a 6E (VI-E) mod and to upgrade a 6E mod to 6A. When mods are increased from 5A to 6E all Primary and Secondary Stats will be increased. Slicing a 6E Mod to 6A will increase a random secondary stat.

As mentioned above in Mod Tier, Secondary Stats can not have more than 4 additional increases to them. Slicing requires Slicing Materials to perform all upgrades. In order to Slice a Mod it must be Level 15 and have 5 dots.

### Slicing Materials Required

| Upgrade | Materials Required |
|---|---|
| Tier 5E to Tier 5D | 10 Mk1 Bonding Pin + 18k Credits |
| Tier 5D to Tier 5C | 5 Mk1 Bonding Pin + 15 Mk1 Fusion Disk + 18k Credits |
| Tier 5C to Tier 5B | 10 Mk1 Fusion Disk + 25 Mk1 Power Flow Control Chip + 63k Credits |
| Tier 5B to Tier 5A | 15 Mk1 Power Flow Control Chip + 1 Mk1 Fusion Coil + 90k Credits |
| 5A to 6E | 50 Mk1 Amplifier + 50 Mk1 Capacitor + 20 Mk2 Pulse Moderator + 200k Credits |
| 6E to 6D | 10 Mk2 Circuit Breaker Module + 36k Credits |
| 6D to 6C | 5 Mk1 Amplifier + 5 Mk1 Capacitor + 10 Mk2 Circuit Breaker Module + 10 Mk2 Thermal Exchange Unit + 72k Credits |
| 6C to 6B | 10 Mk1 Amplifier + 10 Mk1 Capacitor + 10 Mk2 Circuit Breaker Module + 20 Mk2 Thermal Exchange Unit + 10 Mk2 Variable Resistor + 126k Credits |
| 6B to 6A | 30 Mk1 Capacitor + 10 Mk2 Pulse Moderator + 20 Mk2 Thermal Exchange Unit + 20 Mk2 Variable Resistor + 15 Mk2 Microprocessor + 276k Credits |

## Mod Set
The Mod Set determines the stat bonus characters get when they meet the required number of equipped pieces. The first number under Set Bonus is the minimum increase characters will get to that stat for having all required pieces, but some or all are not max level. The bottom number is the max increase characters will get when all of the required number of mods for that set have been maxed out at Level 15. It is important to remember that rarity is not taken into consideration for set bonuses so all mods do not have to be the same rarity to get the set bonus.

| Name and Stat | Required | Minimum | Maximum |
|---|---|---|---|
| Critical Chance | 2 | 4% | 8% |
| Critical Damage | 4 | 15% | 30% |
| Defense | 2 | 12.5% | 25% |
| Health | 2 | 5% | 10% |
| Offense | 4 | 7.5% | 15% |
| Potency | 2 | 7.5% | 15% |
| Speed | 4 | 5% | 10% |
| Tenacity | 2 | 10% | 20% |

## Mod Levels
Each mod can be enhanced by upgrading their Level using Credits, with 15 being max level. Every level will increase the Primary Stat on the mod and at Level 3, 6, 9, and 12 a secondary stat will be added or increased depending on the Tier. When added to mods, secondary stats are chosen at random and when increasing a stat already on a mod, the stat chosen to be increased will be random.

### Leveling Effect on Secondary Stats

| Tier | Level 1 | Level 3 | Level 6 | Level 9 | Level 12 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| E | No Stats | Add Stat | Add Stat | Add Stat | Add Stat |
| D | 1 Stat | Add Stat | Add Stat | Add Stat | Increase Stat |
| C | 2 Stats | Add Stat | Add Stat | Increase Stat | Increase Stat |
| B | 3 Stats | Add Stat | Increase Stat | Increase Stat | Increase Stat |
| A | 4 Stats | Increase Stat | Increase Stat | Increase Stat | Increase Stat |

## Mod Slot
There are 6 modification slots on each character. While these slots have a specific name, they are commonly referred to by the shape instead.

| Name | Shape |
|---|---|
| Transmitter | Square |
| Receiver | Arrow |
| Processor | Diamond |
| Holo-Array | Triangle |
| Data-Bus | Circle |
| Multiplexer | Plus, Cross |

## Primary Stats
Primary stats are the main assigned stat that a mod will increase. There are 11 Primary stats that mods can have: Health, Protection, Defense, Offense, Potency, Tenacity, Speed, Critical Damage, Critical Chance, Accuracy, Critical Avoidance. The increase made to Speed is a flat increase while the rest are percent increases. Which primary stat will appear on a mod depends solely on what slot it is for.

### Primary Stats by Slot

| Slot | Primary Stat |
|---|---|
| Square (Transmitter) | Offense |
| Diamond (Processor) | Defense |
| Circle (Data-Bus) | Health • Protection |
| Arrow (Receiver) | Speed • Accuracy • Critical Avoidance • Health • Protection • Offense • Defense |
| Triangle (Holo-Array) | Critical Chance • Critical Damage • Health • Protection • Offense • Defense |
| Cross (Multiplexer) | Tenacity • Potency • Health • Protection • Offense • Defense |

## Secondary Stats
In addition to the Primary stat, mods can have lesser increases on up to 4 different stats. Depending on the Tier players acquire the mod at, these are usually applied at random to the mod when it reaches certain Levels.

### 5 Dot and 6 Dot Secondary Stat Ranges

### Lower Rarity Secondary Stat Ranges (1-4 Dots)

| Stat | 1 Dot | | 2 Dot | | 3 Dot | | 4 Dot | |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|

## Calibrate
Calibrate allows removing a random increase (roll) from one selected secondary stat and adding an increase (roll) to a secondary stat at random. The new chosen secondary stat can be the same one the roll was removed from. Secondary stats cannot be entirely removed in this process because they must have at least 2 rolls (increases) in order for that stat to be selected for removing an increase. A mod must be at least 6 dots (rarity) in order to calibrate and the higher the tier is, the more times it can be done. Calibrating requires Micro Attenuators, which can be acquired in Mod Battles Map 9.

On the Calibrate screen it shows each secondary stat on the mod and under that it shows a bar for each roll that stat has. The bar represents how close to the max value the roll was for that stat. The Average Quality Slice lets players see how close to the max possible value that stat is at based on the current number of rolls it has. Players can use this information to see if that stat is worth adding more rolls onto based on how well the rolls have been on it so far.

### Calibrate Attempts by Tier

| Mod Rarity/Tier | Attempts Added | Total Attempts |
|---|---|---|
| 6E | 1 | 1 |
| 6D | 1 | 2 |
| 6C | 1 | 3 |
| 6B | 1 | 4 |
| 6A | 2 | 6 |

### Calibrate Costs

| Times Calibrated | Cost (Micro Attenuators) | Total Cost (Micro Attenuators) |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | 15 | 15 |
| 2 | 25 | 40 |
| 3 | 40 | 80 |
| 4 | 75 | 155 |
| 5 | 100 | 255 |
| 6 | 150 | 405 |

## How Increases Work
Mods are used to increase a character's stats, which allows the players the ability to change how their characters base stats work. There are three different ways stats are increased:

### Flat Increase
A direct point by point increase to the specified stat for a character. Any stat shown on a mod that is not a percent will be a flat increase.

**Example:** 100 Offense will increase Physical Damage (PD) and Special Damage (SD) by 100. If a character has 3400 PD and 1200 SD then after applying the 100 Offense the character will have 3500 PD and 1300 SD.

### Stacking Percent Increase
All stacking percents will be added to the current percent the stat is at.

**Example:** 30% Critical Damage will be added to the current Critical Damage percent. If a character has 150% Critical Damage then after applying the mod the character will have 180% Critical Damage.

### Base Percent Increase
All base percents will be added together and then multiplied by the current total points the stat is at to get the increase amount to add.

**Example:** A character has 3400 PD and 1200 SD before adding a mod that has +8.5% Offense. The mod will increase PD to 3689 and SD to 1302.

#### Stat Categories

| Stacking Percents | Critical Chance • Critical Damage • Potency • Tenacity • Accuracy • Critical Avoidance |
|---|---|
| **Base Percents** | **Defense • Health • Protection • Offense** |

## Where to Get Mods

### Mod Store
The Mod Store is where you can spend Ship Building Materials or Credits to buy mods. The rarity of the mods offered in the store will be determined by the highest tier you've completed in Mod Challenges. The Mod store is the best place to get mods because it lets you purchase specific mod slots that let you see exactly what primary and secondary stats the mod will have.

### Mod Battles
Mod Battles use Mod Energy and have a map for each mod set that offers rarity I and II mods. Each map has a mission for each slot so you can farm for specific slots. When you complete Map 3 it will unlock Mod Challenges. Fully completing each map will unlock the corresponding Mod Challenge for the particular set that map offered.

**Current maps:**
- Health
- Defense
- Critical Damage
- Critical Chance
- Tenacity
- Offense
- Potency
- Speed
- Slicing and Calibrate Materials

### Mod Challenges
Mod Challenges unlock as you complete the Mod Battles for the corresponding set and offer rarity III, IV, and V mods. Mod Challenges are the best place to get mods when you're unable to afford Credits and Ship Building Materials for the Mod Store.

### Selling Mods
Unwanted mods can be sold for credits, freeing up limited inventory space and gaining a little bit of currency to help with upgrading others. It is important to note that the more you invest into a mod the more credits you will lose when selling it.

## Notes

Mods were introduced to the game on July 12, 2016. The initial release had mods giving stat increases so high that it threw off the balance of the game and received a huge backlash from the community. On July 15, 2016 the game was updated to give much smaller increases to character stats from mods.

In the datamined game files there are Mod Challenge assets for a Taunt set and a Defense Penetration set that looks like it never made it into the game.

In August of 2018 Mods 2.0 was released in 3 updates that went out on August 23rd, 29th and 30th. These updates included:
- Set bonus changes
- A change in how secondary stats are added and increased
- Slicing mods
- Mod Loadouts
- and much more

On September 13, 2022 a quality of life improvement was added to the game for mods in the Title 14 update. This update included:
- A new screen for enhancing mods
- Calibrate, a new way to remove stat rolls on less important secondary stats and trying to reroll them on better ones
- Mass upgrading
- Improved filter and search

## Data Sources

**NEW AMOUNTS:** Updated 9-18-2022, with the introduction of Calibrate to Mods, the datamined game files have the exact possible amounts for rolls. This new data is what was used to get the min and max roll data for 5 dot and 6 dot mods that are currently displayed.

**OLD AMOUNTS:** Data for rolls was gathered using an api that pulls information straight from the game. The data includes over 800,000 equipped mods from every character in every member's roster for 35 Guilds including the top 15 largest GP guilds in the game as of June 25, 2020.
