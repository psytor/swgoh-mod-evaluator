SWGOH Mod Evaluator - Development Progress Documentation V3
Project Overview
A web-based tool to evaluate Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) mods using React + Vite. The project implements multiple evaluation approaches, starting with a speed-based system and planned to expand to comprehensive efficiency-based evaluation.
Current Status: Phase 3 Complete ✅
Major Updates Since V2
1. Fixed Filter Bar System ✅

Removed old navigation bar: Evaluation mode selector moved to main filter area
Sticky "Your Mods" header: Always visible with all controls in one place
Improved layout: No more mods hidden under the header
Better visual hierarchy: Clear separation between controls and content

2. Multi-Select Toggle Filters ✅
Replaced single dropdown with toggle buttons:

Toggle behavior: Can select multiple filters (Keep + Slice, etc.)
"All" button: Overrides other selections when clicked
OR logic: Shows mods matching ANY selected filter
Visual feedback: Active filters highlighted in blue
Filter display: Shows active filters in mod count text

3. Character Filter Dropdown ✅

Alphabetically sorted: Characters listed by display name
"All Characters" option: Default view showing all mods
Per-character view: Filter to see only one character's mods
Warning indicators: Shows ⚠️ for characters with unmapped names

4. Summary Statistics ✅
Real-time statistics showing:

Color-coded badges: Green (Keep), Red (Sell), Purple (Slice), Orange (Level)
Dynamic counts: Updates as filters change
Contextual display: Only shows relevant stats for current view
Positioned below mod count: Clear visual grouping

5. Character Name Fixes ✅

ID mapping system: Handles deprecated character IDs (e.g., VEERS → VEERS_GENERAL)
Fallback display: Shows character ID with warning if name not found
Warning triangle: Visual indicator for unmapped characters
Maintainable solution: Easy to add new mappings as discovered

Technical Implementation Details
Filter State Management
javascript// Multiple active filters stored in array
const [activeFilters, setActiveFilters] = useState(['all'])

// Toggle logic maintains proper state
toggleFilter = (filterName) => {
  // 'all' overrides everything
  // Empty selection defaults to 'all'
  // Multiple selections allowed
}
Character Name Resolution
javascript// Mapping for edge cases
const CHARACTER_ID_FIXES = {
  'VEERS': 'VEERS_GENERAL',
  // More can be added as found
}

// Returns object with name and warning flag
getCharacterDisplayName(characterId) → {
  name: string,
  hasWarning: boolean
}
Current Features Overview
✅ Completed Features

Ally Code Entry: Clean input with validation and caching
Mod Display: Visual cards with game-accurate sprites
Speed Evaluation: Two modes (Basic/Strict) with thresholds
Efficiency Display: Shows percentage for each stat (informational)

Key Technical Decisions

Incremental Development: Starting with simple speed-based evaluation before complex systems
Client-Side Only: All processing in browser, no backend needed
Component Architecture: Modular design for easy feature addition
Visual First: Game-accurate sprites and clear UI before complex logic
Flexible Evaluation: System designed to support multiple evaluation methods

What's Working Well

✅ Complete filtering system with multiple options
✅ Character name resolution with fallback
✅ Clean, intuitive UI with sticky controls
✅ Summary statistics for quick decisions
✅ Proper state management between components
✅ No HTML validation errors

Next Phase Options
Based on the original comprehensive plan, potential next steps include:

Sorting Implementation

Sort by: Efficiency, Speed, Character, Recommendation
Ascending/Descending options
Maintain sort through filter changes


Mod Locking System

Detect locked status from API
Temporary lock toggle on cards
Prevent locked mods from showing as "Sell"
LocalStorage persistence for temporary locks


Additional Evaluation Methods

Implement "Other Mod Management Guide" approach
Add offense-based evaluation
Progress toward full efficiency system


Export Functionality

CSV export of recommendations
Integration with mod optimizer tools
Shareable recommendation lists


Advanced Features

Batch selection and operations
Mod comparison view
Historical tracking

Code Quality: Clean, modular, ready for expansion

Conclusion
The project has successfully implemented a functional speed-based mod evaluator with excellent filtering capabilities and visual presentation. The foundation is solid for expanding to the comprehensive evaluation system originally envisioned. The incremental approach has proven effective, allowing for testing and refinement at each stage while maintaining a clear path toward the full feature set.
