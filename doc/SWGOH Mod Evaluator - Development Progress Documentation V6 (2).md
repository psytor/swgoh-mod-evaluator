# SWGOH Mod Evaluator - Development Progress Documentation V6

## Project Overview
A web-based tool to evaluate Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) mods using React + Vite. The project implements multiple evaluation approaches incrementally, with a focus on user experience and multi-account management.

## Current Status: Phase 5 Complete with Additional Fixes ✅

### Major Updates Since V5

#### 1. **Efficiency Calculation Fixed** ✅
The roll quality calculation system has been corrected and now properly:

- **Position-Based Scoring**: Calculates how well each stat rolled (0-100%)
- **Accurate Roll Analysis**: Uses `unscaledRollValue` data from API when available
- **Per-Roll Calculation**: Analyzes each individual roll for multi-roll stats
- **Proper Averages**: Correctly averages efficiency across all rolls
- **Collection Statistics**: Shows average roll quality across entire collection

**Important Note**: This "efficiency" display shows roll quality only - it is NOT the comprehensive efficiency evaluation system described in the original project documentation.

#### 2. **Character Names Externalized** ✅
Character name mapping improved for maintainability:

- **External JSON File**: `charname.json` moved outside build directory
- **Server-Side Hosting**: Located at `https://farmroadmap.dynv6.net/mod-evaluator/assets/charname.json`
- **Manual Updates**: Can be updated without rebuilding the application
- **Cached Loading**: Names are fetched once and cached for performance
- **Fallback Handling**: Shows character ID with warning if name not found

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Efficiency Calculation Logic
```javascript
// Corrected calculation using actual roll values
function calculateStatEfficiency(stat, is6Dot = false) {
  const minBound = parseInt(stat.statRollerBoundsMin);
  const maxBound = parseInt(stat.statRollerBoundsMax);
  
  // Uses unscaledRollValue array for accurate per-roll analysis
  if (stat.unscaledRollValue && stat.unscaledRollValue.length > 0) {
    let totalEfficiency = 0;
    
    stat.unscaledRollValue.forEach(rollValue => {
      const value = parseInt(rollValue);
      const range = maxBound - minBound;
      const stepsFromMin = value - minBound;
      const efficiency = ((stepsFromMin + 1) / (range + 1)) * 100;
      totalEfficiency += efficiency;
    });
    
    return totalEfficiency / stat.unscaledRollValue.length;
  }
  
  return 0;
}
```

#### Character Names Loading
```javascript
// External loading with caching
async function loadCharacterNames() {
  if (characterNamesCache) return characterNamesCache;
  
  const response = await fetch('https://farmroadmap.dynv6.net/mod-evaluator/assets/charname.json');
  const data = await response.json();
  characterNamesCache = data;
  return data;
}
```

## Development Approach for Next Phase

### Phase 6: Comprehensive Scoring System (this is a long phase that will be broken down in Latest Evaluation System)
**Approach**: Step-by-step implementation
1. Create scoring calculation functions
2. Implement stat weight system
3. Add synergy detection
4. Build context multipliers
5. Test with various mod examples
6. Integrate into UI gradually

### Phase 7: Expandable Cards
**Approach**: Progressive enhancement
1. Add click handler to mod cards
2. Create expanded view component
3. Design calculation breakdown display
4. Implement smooth expand/collapse animation
5. Show roll history visualization

### Phase 8: Calibration System
**Approach**: Data-driven recommendations
1. Analyze current vs potential stats
2. Calculate improvement possibilities
3. Create priority scoring
4. Design recommendation display
5. Add cost/benefit information

## Key Metrics

- **Evaluation Methods**: 1 of 3+ planned (speed-only implemented)
- **UI Completeness**: ~85% (missing expandable cards, calibration UI)
- **Filter Types**: 6 (Character, Tier, Mode, Recommendation, Locked, All)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, modular, ready for complex scoring
- **Data Accuracy**: Roll calculations verified and working correctly

## Technical Notes

### Roll Quality vs Efficiency
- **Current**: Shows how well each stat rolled (0-100%)
- **Planned**: Full efficiency system with weights, synergy, and context
- **Clear Separation**: UI clearly distinguishes between the two concepts

### External Asset Management
- Character names can be updated without rebuilding
- Future consideration: Move more configuration data external
- Enables community contributions to data accuracy

### Performance Considerations
- Character names cached after first load
- Mod calculations are lightweight and fast
- Ready for more complex calculations in next phase

## Conclusion

The SWGOH Mod Evaluator has reached a stable state with accurate roll quality calculations and robust multi-account management. The externalized character names provide flexibility for updates, and the fixed efficiency calculations give users valuable insights into their mod quality. The application is now well-positioned for the comprehensive scoring system implementation, which will transform it from a simple speed evaluator to a sophisticated mod analysis tool.

The step-by-step approach planned for the next phase ensures that complex features like the full efficiency system, expandable cards, and calibration recommendations can be implemented incrementally while maintaining stability and usability.
