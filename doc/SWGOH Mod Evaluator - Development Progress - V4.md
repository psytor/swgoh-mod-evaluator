# SWGOH Mod Evaluator - Development Progress Documentation V4

## Project Overview
A web-based tool to evaluate Star Wars Galaxy of Heroes (SWGOH) mods using React + Vite. The project implements multiple evaluation approaches incrementally, starting with a speed-based system and planned to expand to comprehensive efficiency-based evaluation as described in the original project documentation.

## Current Status: Phase 4 Complete ✅

### Major Updates Since V3

#### 1. **Mod Locking System** ✅
A comprehensive locking system has been implemented:

- **Game Locks**: Detected from API data (`mod.locked` property)
- **Temporary Locks**: User-toggleable locks stored in localStorage
- **Visual Indicators**: 
  - 🔒 for locked mods (game or temporary)
  - 🔓 for unlocked mods
  - Red background for game-locked
  - Blue background for temp-locked
- **Lock Filter**: New "Locked" toggle in filter bar
- **Evaluation Override**: Locked mods always show as "Keep" regardless of stats

#### 2. **Collection Roll Efficiency Statistics** ✅
New collection-wide statistics showing roll quality:

- **Overall Average**: Shows average roll quality across all displayed mods
- **Breakdown by Recommendation**: 
  - Keep mods average roll quality
  - Sell mods average roll quality
  - Slice mods average roll quality
  - Level mods average roll quality
- **Dynamic Updates**: Stats update based on active filters
- **Visual Display**: Color-coded breakdown beneath mod count

**Important Note**: This "efficiency" is ONLY about roll quality (how close each stat roll is to its maximum possible value). This is NOT the complex efficiency calculation system described in the original project documentation.

#### 3. **Enhanced Filtering** ✅
- **Locked Filter**: Added "Locked" toggle button to filter controls
- **Multiple Filter Logic**: Can now filter by multiple criteria (e.g., Keep + Locked)
- **Filter Display**: Active filters shown in mod count text

### Current Features Overview

#### ✅ Completed Features

**Core Functionality:**
- Ally Code Entry: Clean input with validation and caching
- Mod Display: Visual cards with game-accurate sprites
- API Integration: Direct calls to SWGOH Comlink API

**Evaluation Systems:**
- Speed-Based Evaluation: First implemented method with two modes (Basic/Strict)
- Roll Quality Display: Shows how well each stat rolled (0-100%)
- Recommendations: Keep/Sell/Slice/Level badges

**User Interface:**
- Multi-Filtering: Toggle multiple recommendation types + locked status
- Character Filter: View mods by character
- Summary Stats: At-a-glance decision counts
- Collection Stats: Average roll quality across collection
- Persistent Settings: Evaluation mode and temp locks saved to localStorage

**Visual Features:**
- Game-accurate mod sprites and set icons
- 6-Dot special styling and calibration info
- Color-coded mod borders by tier
- Hover effects and responsive design

#### 🔄 In Progress
- Additional evaluation methods beyond speed-only

#### ❌ Not Yet Implemented
- Sorting options (by roll quality, speed, character)
- Character name fixes (some still show IDs)
- Export functionality
- Comprehensive efficiency-based evaluation (as per original docs)
- Synergy/concentration/alignment calculations
- Other evaluation methods from original plan

### Technical Implementation Details

#### Roll Quality Calculation (Current "Efficiency" Display)
```javascript
// Current implementation - measures roll quality only
function calculateStatEfficiency(stat, is6Dot = false) {
  // Uses position-based approach
  // Discrete for Speed: 3→25%, 4→50%, 5→75%, 6→100%
  // Continuous for other stats
  // Returns percentage indicating how good the roll was
}

// This is NOT the complex efficiency system from original docs
```

#### Locking System
```javascript
// Temporary locks stored in localStorage
localStorage.setItem('swgoh_temp_locked_mods', JSON.stringify([...modIds]))

// Lock evaluation override
if (mod.locked || tempLockedMods.includes(mod.id)) {
  return { type: 'keep', text: 'Locked', className: 'keep' }
}
```

#### Collection Statistics
```javascript
function calculateCollectionEfficiency(mods, evaluationMode, tempLockedMods) {
  // Calculates average roll quality across all mods
  // Breaks down by recommendation type
  // Returns overall average and per-type averages
}
```

## Key Technical Clarifications

### "Efficiency" vs "Roll Quality"
- **Current Display**: Shows roll quality (0-100% based on min/max roll values)
- **Not Implemented**: Complex efficiency calculation with multipliers from original docs
- **User Benefit**: Helps identify mods with good/bad rolls regardless of evaluation method

### Evaluation Methods
- **Currently Implemented**: Speed-based evaluation only
- **Planned**: Multiple evaluation methods users can choose from
- **Design**: Each method will coexist, not replace others

### Incremental Development Approach
1. **Phase 1-3**: Basic setup, speed evaluation, filtering ✅
2. **Phase 4**: Locking system, collection stats ✅
3. **Future Phases**: Additional evaluation methods, sorting, export

## What's Working Well

✅ Complete speed-based evaluation with locking support
✅ Roll quality display for all secondary stats
✅ Collection-wide statistics
✅ Multi-select filtering including locked mods
✅ Clean, intuitive UI with game-accurate visuals
✅ Proper state management and persistence

## Next Phase Options

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Sorting Implementation**
   - Sort by: Roll quality, Speed, Character, Recommendation
   - Ascending/Descending options
   - Maintain sort through filter changes

2. **Character Name Fixes**
   - Complete the CHARACTER_ID_FIXES mapping
   - Handle all edge cases

3. **Export Functionality**
   - CSV export of recommendations
   - Integration with mod optimizer tools

### Future Evaluation Methods
- Implement "Other Mod Management Guide" approach
- Add offense-based evaluation
- Progress toward full efficiency system from original documentation
- Add synergy/concentration/alignment multipliers

## Key Metrics

- **Evaluation Methods**: 1 of 3+ planned (speed-only implemented)
- **UI Completeness**: ~80% (missing sort, export)
- **Original Vision Progress**: ~45% (incremental approach working well)
- **Code Quality**: Clean, modular, ready for expansion

## Conclusion

The project has successfully implemented a functional speed-based mod evaluator with excellent filtering capabilities, locking system, and collection statistics. The roll quality display provides valuable information without being confused with the future comprehensive efficiency system. The incremental approach continues to prove effective, with each phase building cleanly on the previous work while maintaining a clear path toward the full feature set described in the original project documentation.
